It is highly advised that you check out the repository and explore some of the projects under the main solution. Integration tests have been written on supported platforms and give great insight into how the SDK was intended to be leveraged.

###Xamarin/Nuget

You can add the C# library as a Nuget package or from the Xamarin Component store.

Before you can begin using this SDK, you must first [create an application](/dashboard/app/create) in the CloudMine dashboard.
